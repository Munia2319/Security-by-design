# Industrial Automation Security Architecture for Paper Production Plant

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the security architecture for a paper production plant, enabling remote configuration of production line settings by an engineering team located in a different geographical location. The solution addresses both industrial automation requirements and cybersecurity concerns in a critical infrastructure environment.

## Key Aspects:
- **Development Process:** Designed a robust and secure development lifecycle, detailing phases from requirements gathering to implementation.
- **Threat Modeling:** Applied an appropriate threat modeling technique to identify potential vulnerabilities and mitigate risks.
- **Security & Privacy:** Evaluated privacy concerns and identified vulnerabilities, providing actionable security requirements to ensure the safety and integrity of the production line.

## Features:
- Remote configuration of industrial production line settings.
- Security and privacy assessment integrated into the development process.
- Implementation of security controls based on identified vulnerabilities.
